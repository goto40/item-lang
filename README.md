# item-lang

A custom IDL, a reimplementation of [https://github.com/goto40/mdsd](https://github.com/goto40/mdsd).

This is work-in-progress and my playground to play with [langium](https://langium.org/).

## Plan

 - [X] Migrate raw grammar
 - [ ] allow certain keywords (e.g. 'description') as ID in certain cases (e.g. for the name of property definitions)
 - [ ] Scoping
   - [ ] Simple model elements, like types (FQN based)
   - [ ] Formulas
   - [ ] Properties
 - [ ] built-in model (e.g. built-in types and properties)
 - [ ] validation
   - [ ] make list of available validation rules here
 - [ ] test framework setup
 - [ ] tests
   - [ ] make a list of available tests in the original python version
